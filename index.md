## Scope

The workshop focuses on contributions from academia, industry and governmental entities with interdisciplinary backgrounds to facilitate the growth of the new area of digital manufacturing. The topics of interest to the workshop include but are not limited to:

* Security and privacy in digital manufacturing
* Additive manufacturing as a Cyber-physical system
* Artificial intelligence for manufacturing
* Signal processing and robotics for manufacturing
* Network security for digital manufacturing
* Resilient manufacturing systems and cybersecurity
* Intrusion and anomaly detection
* Standards for digital manufacturing
* Control-theoretic approaches in manufacturing
* Encryption and authentication for manufacturing
* Innovations in computer-aided design
* Workforce development and training 

Also, of interest are contributions that can point the research community to new research directions, and those that can set research agendas and priorities in reliable and resilient digital manufacturing.
